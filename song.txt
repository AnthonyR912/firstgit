Someone said they left together 
I ran out the door to get her 
She was holding hands with trevor
Not the Greatest Feeling Ever
She said "Pull yourself together"
You should try your luck with Heather
Then I heard they slept together
Oh the less i know the better 
...
oh my love, cant you see yourself by my side
No surprise, you're on his shoulder like every night 
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side. 
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye.
